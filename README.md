# Sentiment_Analysis_of_Restaurant_Reviews
# Sentiment Analysis on Restaurant Reviews using Google Colab

## Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that accurately classifies reviews into positive or negative sentiments, providing valuable insights for restaurant owners and stakeholders.

## Google Colab Setup

1. **Open the Google Colab Notebook:**
   - Click on the [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/) link.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```python
   !git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-sentiment-analysis.git
   %cd restaurant-sentiment-analysis
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Working with Colab Notebooks

- If you have a notebook (`sentiment_analysis.ipynb`), open it in Colab and follow the steps inside.

## Data Preparation

1. **Upload Dataset:**
   - Manually upload your dataset (`Restaurant_Reviews.tsv`) to the Colab environment.

2. **Run Data Preprocessing:**
   ```python
   # Execute the data preprocessing steps in the notebook
   ```

## Training the Model

1. **Run Model Training:**
   ```python
   # Execute the model training steps in the notebook
   ```

2. **Evaluate Model Performance:**
   ```python
   # Execute the model evaluation steps in the notebook
   ```

## Hyperparameter Tuning

1. **Tune Hyperparameters:**
   ```python
   # Execute the hyperparameter tuning steps in the notebook
   ```

2. **Optimal Model:**
   Update `classifier = MultinomialNB(alpha=0.2)` in the notebook with the optimal hyperparameter values.

## Predicting Sentiments

1. **Run Sentiment Prediction:**
   ```python
   # Execute the sentiment prediction steps in the notebook
   ```

2. **Input New Review:**
   Modify the `sample_review` variable in the notebook with your desired review.

## Results and Visualizations

- The notebook includes sections for generating accuracy, precision, recall scores, and a confusion matrix.
- Visualizations, such as a heatmap of the confusion matrix, are created within the notebook.

## Conclusion

This sentiment analysis project provides actionable insights for restaurant owners to enhance customer satisfaction, improve operational efficiency, and make data-driven decisions.

Feel free to explore and adapt the notebook based on your requirements.

Happy analyzing!
